This idea was started on the AudioGames.net forum in [This topic](https://forum.audiogames.net/topic/29717/the-toxicities-of-the-developer-community). It is not an attempt to replace or supercede the [Awesome](https://awesome.re) lists.

# Conventions

This list follows some very simple conventions:

* Resources that have an International Standards Book Number (ISBN) (or a set of them in those rare instances) following their title in parentheses are guaranteed to be paid. For those rare instances where a book is not paid, I shall indicate such. The ISBN is a 10-, 13- or 16-digit number, i.e.: 9780262140874344. The ISBN can be used to locate the exact book, since titles can be ambiguous.
* Resources that do not have an ISBN in parentheses are guaranteed to be free unless specified otherwise.

# Getting started

If you need help acquiring a compiler or toolchain for a programming language, check out [this page on RosettaCode](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Newbie), which lists various instructions for various languages. The task "assumes the language-newbie is a programmer in another language, the language-newbie is competent in installing software for the platform, and the language-newbie can use one simple text editor for the OS/platform (but that may not necessarily be a particular one if the installation needs a particular editor); refers to (and links to) already existing documentation as much as possible (but provides a summary on that page); demonstrates where to view the output; and, if particular IDE's or editors are required that are not standard, then points to/explains their installation."

For "Hello world!" type examples, see the following pages on that same wiki:

* [Display the string       Goodbye, World!       on a GUI object   (alert box, plain window, text area, etc.)](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Graphical)
* [Cause a line printer attached to the computer to print a line containing the message:   Hello World!](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Line_printer)
* [Display the string   Goodbye, World!   without a trailing newline](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Newline_omission)
* [Show how to print a message to standard error by printing     Goodbye, World!     on that stream](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Standard_error)
* [Above task with esoteric languages](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Standard_error/Esoteric)
* [Display the string Hello world! on a text console](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Text)
* [Serve our standard text   Goodbye, World!   to   http://localhost:8080/   so that it can be viewed with a web browser](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Hello_world/Web_server)

# IDEs and Editors

Though these aren't books, here are some good IDEs and text editors for programming:

# # Text Editors

* [Notepad 2](http://www.flos-freeware.ch/notepad2.html) (and [Notepad 3](https://www.rizonesoft.com/downloads/notepad3)): my favorite editor on Windows. I use Notepad 2, not Notepad 3; they both appear to be identical in functionality (or maybe I'm missing something). Both are fully accessible.
* [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/): a very good editor indeed for programmers. Fully accessible.

# Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

* [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/): by far the premeer IDE on windows. Accessible, though it can be very slow at times.
* [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Not really an IdE, though you can turn it into one. Accessible (depending on what you do and who you ask).
* [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/eclipseide/): A very powerful and extensible IDE written in Java using the SWT widget toolkit. Fully accessible on Windows (though I believe its also accessible on Linux). Does not support Python out of the box. Note -- the installer is not accessible; use the downloadable zip files.
